## Open source projects

* [202ecommerce/PayPal]([202ecommerce/paypal (github.com)](https://github.com/202ecommerce/paypal)) This is a complete PayPal integration (supports 8.x). :warning: Warning: this claims to be an official "module" from PayPal, but no evidence is provided of it being official.

## How to add to this list

1. The [current version of PrestaShop]([Releases · PrestaShop/PrestaShop (github.com)](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/releases)) is 8.x and the PrestaShop project [only supports the latest release]([Security Overview · PrestaShop/PrestaShop (github.com)](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/security)). Therefore every module on this must support the 8.x version of PrestaShop.
2. Ensure that the module includes a community feature where people could post issues/questions and see if other people have posted issues/questions (e.g. such as using GitHub with issues turned on)
